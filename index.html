   <h1> 3 Key Takeaways for HTML</h1>
  </header>
  
  <main>
<h1> Accessability Purposes</h1>
<p>This week I learned about how HTML can utilize tools for accessability so that technologies like screenreaders can better navigate websites. 
I learned about the uses of meta tags, and why to compartmentalize different sections into the header, main sections or footer. Firstly, 
this allows certain elements such as images or page designs to be described to somebody unable to see the layout on their screen alone. Secondly, the HTML descriptions of tags are 
useful so that those using screen readers can quickly skip to the content most relevant to them as a web user--whether it be the titles on the header, the main content
overall or additional contact links on the footer. Learning about the way to employ the use of colors on my website can also help organize elements in a way that
is accessable to those reading, as certain combinations like golden text on a yellow background can be difficult to see.

<h1>Stylesheets</h1>
<p>Stylesheets, while writing in sheets control how formatting elements like <code>em</code> or <code>strong</code> appear on the screen. While one can use a default, 
constructed stylesheets can allow users to change attributes of a particular element such as background/text color, borders and the size or possible selection of a font in the execution of 
elements like code examples or emphasized formatting. Users can include a stylesheet by including it in the head section as a style block, linking 
one or multiple .css extention stylesheet in the head or using it as an attribute within an element.</p>
    
<h1>GitHub Pages and Semantic Elements</h1>
<p>This week I learned about how to create a web project via GitHub itself using the "Pages" option in settings. I learned what is needed to set up one's site with 
an index.html to initiate the overall function and a style sheet such as "web.css" to control the form/shape of the page in general. After deploying one's folder one can make updates to 
their files and refresh to see updates on their site. Editing the web.css can change the elements of the body such as the font, font size, and font family, which 
establishes both the font the writer wants to be in use, and alternatives fonts for the site to access incase certain ones are not installed within the system. Other 
semantic elements include background colors and text colors of one's sections. Although, link text is automatically colored blue by default, so one needs to change the "a" 
element for link color in order to change said text. I also learned about changing the padding space within, or margin spacing outside, a block element by either pixels, 
points or "em" to automatically match the size to an amount of lines of text.</p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p> In conclusion this week I learned how to set up an HTML site within GitHub itself, and utilize stylesheets to change the way elements behave with CSS. I learned how to add margins and
change sizes with pixels, points and line matching elements, and ensure the site can adapt to a usuable font with font families.</p>
