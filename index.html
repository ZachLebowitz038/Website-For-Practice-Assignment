   <h1> 3 Key Takeaways for HTML</h1>

<h1> Accessability Purposes</h1>
<p>This week I learned about how HTML can utilize tools for accessability so that technologies like screenreaders can better navigate websites. 
The learned about the uses of meta tags, and why to compartmentalize different sections into the header, main sections or footer. This is so that, firstly, 
certain elements such as images or page design can be described to somebody unable to see the layout on their screen alone. The HTML descriptions of tags are 
useful so that those using screen readers can quickly skip to the content most relevant to them as a web user Be it the titles on the header, the main content
overall or additional contact links on the footer. Learning about the way to employ the use of colors on my website can also help organize content in a way that
is accessable to those reading, as certain combinations like golden text on a yellow background can be difficult to see.

<h1>GitHub Pages</h1>
<p>This week I learned about how to create a web project via GitHub itself using the "Pages" option in settings. I learned what is needed to set up one's site with 
an index.html to initiate the overall function and a web.css to control the form/shape of the page in general. After deploying one's folder one can make updates to 
their files and refresh to see updates on their site. Editing the web.css can change the elements of the body such as the font, font size, and font family, which 
establishes both the font the writer wants to be in use, and alternatives fonts for the site to access incase certain ones are not installed within the system. Other 
semantic elements include background colors and text colors of one's sections. Although, link text is automatically colored blue by default, one needs to change the "a" 
element for link color in order to change said text. I also learned about changing the padding space within a block element by either pixels, points or "em" to automatically
match the size to an amount of lines of text.</p>
